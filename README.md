Project "Fraudulent Transactions Detection System"

Description:
A company providing banking services to the population has encountered fraudulent transactions. To address this issue, the management has decided to implement a machine learning-based module that will evaluate transactions in real-time and reject suspicious operations.

Project Goals:

Develop and implement a module for detecting fraudulent transactions.
Enhance the company's competitiveness by ensuring the reliability and security of online payments.
Key Points:

Project budget - not exceeding 10 million rubles, timeframe - six months.
Project results should be at least as good as competitors'.
The system should process up to 400 transactions per second.
If the system detects a legitimate transaction as fraudulent, it will be rejected.
Customer churn due to exceeding a 5% fraud transaction rate is not acceptable.
Transaction data is stored in CSV files.
Confidentiality of customer data is mandatory.
Technical Specifications:

Deployment of the module on cloud resources.
Processing data from CSV files.
Utilization of machine learning for real-time transaction analysis.
Planned Actions:

Develop and deploy the fraudulent transactions detection module.
Test the system's performance on real data.
Assess the costs of maintaining cloud infrastructure and optimize them.
Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer data.
GitHub:
The repository will contain the code and deployment instructions for the module, as well as reports on testing results and cost assessments.
